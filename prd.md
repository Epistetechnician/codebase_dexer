# PRD: MCP Code Indexer

## 1. Product overview
### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: MCP Code Indexer
- Version: 1.0.0

### 1.2 Product summary
MCP Code Indexer is a tool designed to improve how language models understand and interact with codebases. By generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) of a codebase and storing it in a Neo4j graph database, the tool creates a simplified representation of classes, methods, functions, and their interrelationships. This allows for more efficient code analysis, targeted refactoring, and better context management when working with large codebases.

The tool addresses a critical limitation of current LLMs that struggle to properly understand repository structure and tend to get overloaded with information when presented with entire codebases.

## 2. Goals
### 2.1 Business goals
- Create a solution that improves LLM interactions with codebases by providing structured context
- Reduce the token consumption and improve response quality of LLMs when working with code
- Enable more accurate code modifications and refactorings by providing precise structural context
- Integrate seamlessly with existing MCP client workflows

### 2.2 User goals
- Understand complex codebases more easily with visual representation
- Target specific sections of code for refactoring without analyzing the entire codebase
- Get more accurate and contextually relevant responses from LLMs when asking about code
- Reduce errors in LLM-generated code modifications by providing better structural context
- Save time by automating repetitive code refactoring tasks

## 6. Narrative
Alex is a senior developer who often works with large, complex codebases. When trying to refactor code, he struggles to get LLMs to understand the repository structure, leading to incomplete or incorrect code modifications. With MCP Code Indexer, Alex can visualize his codebase as a graph of interconnected functions and classes. When he wants to refactor a specific feature, he simply selects the relevant nodes and the system intelligently includes all necessary dependencies. The LLM now has precise context about the structure and relationships, resulting in accurate refactoring suggestions that work the first time, saving Alex hours of back-and-forth corrections.
